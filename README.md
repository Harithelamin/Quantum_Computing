5 - Scattering on a double well: Resonances 
This projects rests heavily on what we did in Exercise 2.4.1 in the quantum physics compendium. 
However, in this case, we will apply a double barrier, 
𝑉(𝑥)=𝑉𝑠(𝑥−𝑑)+𝑉𝑠(𝑥+𝑑), 
where 𝑉𝑠(𝑥) is the potential given in equation 2.27 in the compendium. It is important that the 
separation between the barriers, 2𝑑, is considerably larger than the width, 𝑤, of each barrier. Finally, 
the barriers should not be too wide. 
Now, with an initial Gaussian placed wave function placed to the left of the double barrier with a 
positive initial mean momentum, solve the Schrödinger equation in order to determine the 
transmission and reflection probability. Do this repeatedly with initial energy ranging from (almost) 0 
to 𝑉0 – the heigth of the barriers. Finally, plot the transmission probability as a function of initial 
energy or momentum 
The result may be a bit unexpected.
