#Task
This project aligns with Exercise 3.2.2 in the quantum physics compendium. It addresses a single-
particle quantum system with a potential of the form 
𝑉(𝑥)=1
2 𝑥2 ; 
this potential is typically referred to as the harmonic oscillator. In this case, the energy spectrum is 
purely discrete and particularly simple: 
𝐸𝑛 =ℏ(𝑛+12), 
where n is an integer and we have assumed the particle mass to be 1. By carefully designing a specific 
initial wave function as a linear combination of the eigen states of the Hamiltonian, we may have the 
system behave almost as if it were classical. The project consists in simulating this – and compare the 
behaviour of the wave function with how a classical particle would behave. (It may be more similar 
than you would think.)
